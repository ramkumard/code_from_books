This file contains a small test for the literate ruby
quiz. 

It is meant to be run from the command line with some arguments.
Here, we simply begin with displaying the command-line arguments

p ARGV

Who are we ??

puts "Here is #{$0}"

Then, just to show, we require the file required.lrb
require 'required'

We complain if there is not arguments on the command-line
puts "It will be more interesting if "+
"you actually provide #$0 with command-line arguments" if ARGV.empty? 

Then, I thought it would be interesting to make a small report about
letters used in the command-line arguments:
\begin{code}
letters = {}
for letter in ARGV.join('').split('')
  if letters.has_key?(letter)
    letters[letter] += 1
  else
    letters[letter] = 1
  end
end

for letter in letters.keys.sort
  puts "Letter #{letter} used #{letters[letter]} times"
end
\end{code}

And just for fun, we will show that we can use \end{code}
right in the middle of some code:
\begin{code}
puts <<'EOT'
You see that we can use
@@\end{code}
even alone on its line !!
EOT
\end{code}

I believe this should suffice as a demonstration.
Just a test file to show that code can be required fine
with rweb:
\begin{code}
puts "This is required literate code !"
\end{code}
