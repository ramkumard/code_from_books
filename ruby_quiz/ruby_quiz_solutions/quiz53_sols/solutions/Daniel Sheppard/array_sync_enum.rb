#Oh, I love you SyncEnumerator, but you're just so impractically slow. A quick test suggest this is about 10,000 times faster. YMMV
#Works as long as the shortest of the two arguments responds to [] in the same way as an array and both enums respond to size()
#(if both enums are the same length, pass in the array first).
