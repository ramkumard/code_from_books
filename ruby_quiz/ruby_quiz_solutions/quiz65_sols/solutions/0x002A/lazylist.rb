# = lazylist.rb - Implementation of lazy lists for Ruby
#
# == Description
#
# This class implements lazy lists (or streams) for Ruby. Such lists avoid the
# computation of values which aren't needed for some computation. So it's
# possible to define infinite lists with a limited amount of memory. A value
# that hasn't been used yet is calculated on the fly and saved into the list.
# A value which is used for a second time is computed only once and just read
# out of memory for the second usage.

# 
# == Example
#
# To compute the square numbers with a lazy list you can define one as
#
#  sq = LazyList.tabulate(1) { |x| x * x }
#
# Now it's possible to get the first 10 square numbers by calling
# LazyList#take
#
#  sq.take(10)
#      ==>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
#
# To compute the first 10 square numbers and do something with them you can
# call the each method with:
#
#  sq.each(10) { |x| puts x }
#
# To compute every square number and do something with them you can call the
# "each" method without an argument:
#
#  sq.each { |x| puts x }
#
# Notice that calls to each without an argument will not return if applied to
# infinite lazy lists.
#
# You can also use indices on lazy lists to get the values at a certain range:
#
#  sq[ 0..9 ] or sq[0, 10]
#      ==>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# 
# To spare memory it's possible to throw away every element after it was
# fetched:
#
#  sq.take!(1) => [1]
#  sq.take!(1) => [4]
#
# Of course it's also possible to compute more complex lists like the Fibonacci
# sequence:
#
#  fib = LazyList.tabulate(0) { |x| x < 2 ? 1 : fib[x-2] + fib[x-1] }
#
#  fib[100] => 573147844013817084101
# computes the 99th Fibonacci number. (We always start with index 0.)
#  fib[101] => 927372692193078999176
# computes the 100th Fibonacci number. The already computed values are reused
# to compute this result. That's a very transparent way to get memoization for
# sequences that require heavy computation.
# 
# You can create lazy lists that are based on arbitrary Enumerables, so can for
# example wrap your passwd file in one pretty easily:
#
#  pw = LazyList[ File.new("/etc/passwd") ]
# 
# Call grep to find the users root and flori:
# pw.grep /^(root|flori):/ => ["root:x:0:0:...\n",... ]
#
# In this case the whole passwd file is slurped into the memory. If
# you use 
#  pw.find { |x| x =~ /^root:/ } => "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n"
# instead, only every line until the root line is loaded into the memory.
#
