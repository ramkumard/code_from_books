# Will respond with an optimal choice to the enemy's choice in order to win.
# If it detects its own tactic being used against it, it will respond just
# like the JEGPaperPlayer would have by always picking :paper.
# Chances of winning could be improved by detecting the choices done by
# players using rand(), but that would require a way of detecting the
# state of Ruby's random number generator. This could be done by using
# srand() to get the seed and calling rand() multiple times with
# Thread.exclusive set to true to get an identification sequence and
# then carefully synchronizing the simulated RNG with the real one. This
# would however still not fool players that use a background thread to
# non-deterministically eat up random numbers.
