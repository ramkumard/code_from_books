#require 'set'

# requires the implementation of an each_neighbour method which must yield the neighbours of an object, and optionally the 'cost' of the link.
# it doesn't require the full object list - it builds the list as it goes. Would probably be faster if it had the whole list, but I wanted to keep the
# code generic
