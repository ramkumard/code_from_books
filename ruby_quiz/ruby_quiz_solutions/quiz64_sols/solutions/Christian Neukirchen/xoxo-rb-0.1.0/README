= xoxo.rb, a XOXO parser and generator for Ruby

== What is xoxo.rb?

xoxo.rb is a Ruby library for loading and dumping data as
XOXO[http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo], an simple, open outline
format written in standard XHTML and suitable for embedding in
(X)HTML, Atom, RSS, and arbitrary XML.

xoxo.rb is a straight port of the functionality of
xoxo.py[http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo-sample-code#Python], but
with an API more similar to Marshal and YAML.


== Current limitations

* No special support for encodings other than UTF-8.  Especially note
  that <tt>http-equiv</tt> headers are not respected.

* XOXO.dump only can dump these Ruby core classes:
  * String
  * Array
  * Hashes that have string (+to_s+) keys
  Other objects will be flattened with +to_s+.
