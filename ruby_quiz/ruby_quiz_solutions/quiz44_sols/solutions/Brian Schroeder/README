This extension is under the same license as ruby.

Do not hold me reliable for anything that happens to you, your programs or
anything else because of this extension. It worked for me, but there is no
guarantee it will work for you.

## Installation
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make

put priority_queue.so somewhere where your program can find it. E.g. /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/priority_queue.so

## Usage

    require 'priority_queue'

    q = PriorityQueue.new
    q.push "node1", 0 
    q.puts "node2", 1

    q.min #=> "node1"

    q.decrease_priority("node2", -1)

    q.pop_min #=> "node2"
    q.min     #=> "node1"
