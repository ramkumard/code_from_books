Subject: TAB: Wonderwall  by Oasis

>From Fred Lidskog <swede@email.unc.edu>

Wonderwall, written by Noel Gallagher, performed by Oasis.
Song can be found on the album "(What's The Story) Morning Glory?" and was
released as a single in the UK and the US.

I've seen alot of transcriptions of this song that have the correct chords
listed, but have left out the song's guitar fills, the parts played by the
second and third guitar, and the often overlooked (and faintly heard) riff
at the very end of the track, so here goes.

To play this song along with the CD, you must put a capo behind the 2nd
fret and play the following chords. All tablature positions are relative
to the capo. 

Chords used:

	 EADGBe
Em7	(022033)
G	(320033)
Dsus4	(xx0233)
A7sus4	(x02033)
Cadd9	(x32033)
Dsus4/F#  (2x0233) [note:some people think this is a G/F# (200033)]

Here's the rythym of how the chord in the verses should be played:

   Em7		  G		 Dsus4	     A7sus4
e--3--3--3--3-3-3-3-3--3--3-3--3-3-3--3--3-3-3--3--3-3-3-3-3-3-3----
B--3--3--3--3-3-3-3-3--3--3-3--3-3-3--3--3-3-3--3--3-3-3-3-3-3-3----
G--0--0--0--0-0-0-0-0--0--0-0--0-2-2--2--2-0-0--0--0-0-0-0-0-0-0----
D--2--2--2--2-2-2-0-0--0--0-0--0-0-0--0--0-0-2--2--0-2-2-0-2-2-0----

[ANOTHER NOTE: play all "A7sus4"'s in the verses the way it is played in
the rythym section above.]
