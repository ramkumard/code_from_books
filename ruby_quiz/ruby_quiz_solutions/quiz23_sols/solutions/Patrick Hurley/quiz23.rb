# == Synopsis
#
# Ruby Quiz #23
#
# The quoted printable encoding is used in primarily in email, thought it has
# recently seen some use in XML areas as well. The encoding is simple to
# translate to and from.
#
# This week's quiz is to build a filter that handles quoted printable
# translation.
#
# Your script should be a standard Unix filter, reading from files listed on
# the command-line or STDIN and writing to STDOUT. In normal operation, the
# script should encode all text read in the quoted printable format. However,
# your script should also support a -d command-line option and when present,
# text should be decoded from quoted printable instead. Finally, your script
# should understand a -x command-line option and when given, it should encode
# <, > and & for use with XML.
#
# == Usage
#
#    ruby quiz23.rb [-d | --decode ] [ -x | --xml ]
